title: Study groups at Mars College
description: Academic life on Mars revolves around a collection of study groups, ranging from those learning about technology (e.g. AI, VR/XR, telepresence), to those focused on life skills (e.g. culinary arts, vanlife, fitness, work-remote), to those dedicated to art and creativity (e.g. music, dance, crafts).

        Study groups make life on Mars lively and help camp run smoothly. They come in many forms, ranging from weekly meetings around specific topics like 'Machine Learning Mondays', ongoing collaborative projects like building Chiba, or learning about and taking care of core infrastructure like solar / water / waste & wifi.

        Members are encouraged to participate in those study groups which interest them, and can initiate new ones. Everyone gets to be a teacher and a learner, and contribute to the overall programming in some way.

        There are no full-time educators at Mars College; we are a federation of people trying to pool our skills and learn together. As such, study groups are mostly self-directed, and are encouraged to leverage online courses, blogs, open-source materials, and other free online resources to educate themselves and the community about their findings.

        We are interested in helping our members figure out how to make a living from Mars. 
        Down the road, those study groups that have commercial applications can potentially earn their members a revenue stream or even spin off separate ventures or enterprises.

        Study groups are not yet precisely determined, and won't be finalized until we begin the quarter. Several informal study groups emerged at <a href="https://brahman.ai">BRAHMAN</a>. They are listed below, along with links to their work. We are using these as a starting point for possible study groups.
